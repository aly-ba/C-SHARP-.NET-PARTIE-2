In this chapter I am trying to show the usage of Command Design Pattern. This is a
popular pattern and it is making use of good object oriented constructs and
simplifies the logic of enabling Undo functionality in our applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pattern says that all the operations should be converted into objects, so that we
log the objects. In future we can call Do() or Undo() operations on the object. The
object should be smart enough to store the request parameters inside it to support
the Do and Undo operations.
